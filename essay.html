            </ul>

            <p>Investigating: For my personal project, I chose to create a communications website, in order to help out the Syrian Refugees, by researching on how to put ads on a website, how to code and how to design and create my own website, to expand my understanding and ability to create other websites in the future. I chose this project because I have always had a passion in programming, and I knew that this project would allow me to continue and advance my knowledge of different challenges and techniques of coding. Building a communication website is a highly challenging task, as I have never made such a professional web-app. I chose science and technical innovation as my global context because the project is an improvement in technology by making the functionality of a phone on any device. I made my research focus on creating a more technically advanced website rather than a more aesthetically pleasing website. I was able to achieve a lot of goals set for myself, but in order for me to achieve those goals, I had prior knowledge and research. Before the beginning of this project, I had taken some courses online and in class, on programming. I took a technology class in 7th grade, where I was first introduced in HTML and JavaScript. I then took my knowledge forward to learning CSS from YouTube and TeamTreehouse. In those classes I was able to learn how to fully develop a full fledged website which enabled me to create something even better than what I have done in the past in this project. Using all previous knowledge I was able to code in all three languages to make Devissy, the name of my website. Research For my research, I used a variety of sources that were relevant to my topic. I used many videos, books, articles, and previous websites I had created. Based on my global context, improving technology and making it compatible with many devices was on my mind, which led me to take a “mobile-friendly” approach. But making it compatible for smaller devices did not stop me from teaching and learning more about ViOP, learning about new techniques for making a aesthetic design, improving my CSS and learning how to create a signup and login. I was able to combine all reachered used into one, like a puzzle. Because of the research, I learned about what techniques I would need to use, what websites I would need to to help me make the website, and how I would go about designing it. The sources I used are listed in Appendix A. To evaluate my sources I chose, I determined their values and limits by looking at their origin, purpose, and content. My best OPCVLs are in Appendix B. When researching evaluation on the credibility of the source was on my mind, but determining the values and limitations by looking at their origin, purpose, and content. I chose all my sources to be as valuable as possible, by finding sources with a valuable origin, purpose and content. I was able to determine that the sources were all credible by looking at the published by authors, and their background and to see if they were helpful for me to continue in reacheringing and using that source or not. I learned a lot from these sources, they helped me formulate decisions about how to go about the project.However, I needed to revise my timeline, as I had miscalculated on how much work I would have been receiving, and created a new one, which was excellent, as I was able to follow everything perfectly as it was easier to follow and achieve as I had experience on what I did wrong. Another part of the process in beginning my project was developing a good plan, as shown in Appendix C. The plan I made for my project was very useful and was followed and affected my research, as it helped me know what I wanted to reacherch and do, and also shaped how I would make the website and the functions of the website. Throughout the making of my project, I demonstrated communication and social skills by asking advice for aesthetics from my classmates, friends and family and learning what would be best for the website. Luckily, I had a mentor to help me out when I got stuck, who knew more on how to create a login and signup how to fix it, as he himself had done it before. Reflection: My goal was to produce a unique and high quality web application that allows users to call from any device to any phone, while researching and analyzing other code. I am impressed and happy with the final result of my project, as I was able to achieve two main things about my project I wanted to achieve, which was calling and texting. I am also happy as I was able to complete most of my criterion without changing them. For criterion one and two, I said that I would make sure that it is user friendly and not hard to use, by asking many people from different views and different backgrounds to see how they like the website and its usability, which I have done through asking a variety of people, such as family and friends. For my second criterion, I said that I would I would sure that my website works on different platforms such as Windows, macOS, Linux, Android and iOS. For my third criterion I said that I will make sure that all the features work properly and all the time, without any errors, which will be measured by calling different numbers, from anywhere, and make sure it works all the time. Which is what I was able to achieve, the only thing I had to alter was using people from around the world, many from France to test out the website and to call me to my phone, as I have not yet had the time to contact them, put plan in the future. I have made a survey for feedback as a link on my website in order for people to tell me what I could improve on.
